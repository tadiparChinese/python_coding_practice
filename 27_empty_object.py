# In Python, you can use one of the two methods of creating empty objects: 
# using language's syntax and by calling a constructor function, 
# whose name is the name of the data type. The only exception is creating an empty set, 
# there is no syntactic sugar, and you use "set()" instead.

d2 = dict()

set1 = set() #set
#set2 = () #NO, as it is a dictionary
